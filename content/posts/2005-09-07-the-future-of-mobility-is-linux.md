I try to keep a close eye on mobile phone technology, I&#8217;ve been invoved in some projects where phones & the GPRS network have been used for some very interesting applications, Russel Beattie has an interesting article on how Linux is now or is going to be the platform of choice, [here][1]. He also has a neat phrase _&#8220;Linux is inexpensive, has no strategy tax (like Microsoft)&#8221;_. Love it.

Browsing through the rest of Russel&#8217;s notes, he has [pod2mob][2], which looks interesting, but seems to be US centric, i.e. doesn&#8217;t like my UK mobile number üôÅ
