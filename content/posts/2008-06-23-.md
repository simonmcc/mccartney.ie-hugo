I&#8217;m currently working on a prototype for one of customers, we are building a BPM system for one of their processes that varies hugely across their organisation. Essentially it&#8217;s simple, they want to automate the signup process for one of there services. This is implemented in a subtly different manor in each region, and the duration can vary hugely. We are trying to make it as light a touch for each region as possible, to the point where the onus is all back on the person or organisation initiating the signup.

This process is throwing up all sorts of interesting challenges in how a process is supposed to happen and what actually happens, where management think the delay & cost is compared to where the actual delap & cost comes from.

We have two deliverables for the customer to help them:

  * An Interactive Demo/Screencast
  
    This is so that they have something sweet and tasty to demonstrate to internal managers & buyers
  * A Comprehensive Process Implementation & Integration Document
  
    When the buyers have been convinced, their technical people need to be brought on board, this is a much more complex task, we have to convince them that the new solution will not be a step backwards in functionality with respect to any local customisations they have done and offers a real benefit

At the moment our main challenge is coming from trying to prototype in the antithesis of a prototyping environment, we are working on the JBoss jBPM platform, as this is closest to the customer environment. I have this gut feeling that if I had cranked out a demo in Ruby on Rails using some form of implied state machine (as described [here][1] by the ever talented [Ana][2] on a [thread][3] in Ruby Ireland) I would have been done ages ago.

But then I suppose we would have had to go through a lot of the jBPM learning at a later date&#8230;
