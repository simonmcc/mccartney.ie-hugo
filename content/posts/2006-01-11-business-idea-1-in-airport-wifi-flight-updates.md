So your sitting the departure lounge of one of the &#8220;silent&#8221; airports, like most airports these days are, and all the seats facing the departure screens (the ones telling you which gate to go to..) are full, so you grab a seat else where, whip out the laptop like you were going to anyway, logonto the local WiFi provider, and as part of the service, you get a little ticker telling you about the flights, you could even tell it about your flight so that it only bugs you when your flight is being called!! If somebody makes money from this, I want a cut ðŸ™‚
