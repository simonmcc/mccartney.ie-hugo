After I made the move from [mutt][1], which is one of the most customizable email tools for power users, one of the features I missed the most was ignore & unignore statements, which allow you to control what headers get shown. For a while I have been using a button/extension called [&#8220;View Headers Toggle Button&#8221;][2], then I found [mnenhy][3], which allows you to pick & choose which headers you get to view in the normal email reading window. Class.
