<a target="_blank" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> has an excellent set of brief articles on management styles in IT (focused on software developement, but I believe the comments apply across the board for creative technology[1] roles)

They are as follows:

  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/07.html">Introduction &#8211; Three Management Methods</a>
  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/08.html">The Command and Control Management Method</a>
  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/09.html">The Econ 101 Management Method</a>
  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/10.html">The Identity Management Method</a>

Worth a read if your management or managed. I work with several ex-military people, where we have a mix of C&#038;C and measurement&#8230;I&#8217;m still mulling over what that means ðŸ™‚

[1] Technology workers split into 2 camps, those of us who design, implement &#038; maintain any kind of IT system and the end users. I&#8217;m focusing on the former, but end users shouldn&#8217;t be devoid of creative thought, they are the actual users of systems we create.
