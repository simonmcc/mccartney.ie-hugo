A few weeks back I had the great pleasure of joining a [#c9d9][1] panel hosted by [Sam Fell][2] on [Continuous Delivery in Huge Scale Deployments][3], alongside me were [Andrew Siemer][4], [Malcolm Isaacs][5] & [Seb Rose][6] who all brought a wealth of practical experience on maintaining velocity in large environments, I thoroughly enjoyed it!  If Continuous Everything is your current boggle, go take a look at all of the [past recordings][1] & there post packed [Continuous Delivery blog][7], it&#8217;s well worth a read!
