I look after a couple of domains for some friends, these used to be spread out over several virtual machines (via the excellent people at [RimuHosting][1]), but I&#8217;ve been doing some consolidation recently.

I use sendmail &#038; Cyrus for mail, here&#8217;s a simple guide to migrating mail from one system to another.

  1. Sync up the mail boxes using something like this:
  
    **rsyncrsync -avz &#8211;delete &#8211;rsh=ssh root@oldhost:/var/spool/cyrus/mail/* /var/spool/cyrus/mail/**
  2. Stop sendmail &#038; cyrus on the old machine
  3. Sync again
  4. Reconstruct the mailboxes (this adds the mailboxes you have been syncing into the new system)
  
    [cyrreconstruct -m is broken in Debian, so manually create the mailbox, and then force a rebuild of sub-mailboxes]
  
    $ **cyradm -u mailadmin localhost**
  
    IMAP Password:
  
    localhost> **cm user.new-user**
  
    localhost> **quit**
  
    $ **su &#8211; cyrus -c &#8220;cyrreconstruct -p /var/spool/cyrus/mail/ -f -r user.new-user&#8221;**
  5. Create local accounts (C&#038;P from /etc/passwd &#038; /etc/shadow)
  6. Merge any chnages you made to:

  1. aliases
  2. virtusertable
  3. local-host-names
  4. access
