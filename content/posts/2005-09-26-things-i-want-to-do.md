..some projects i wish I had more time to work on:

Mobile Phone Bill Parser &#8211; I&#8217;ve started this, in Perl with CDBI, it&#8217;ll load in an O2 downloaded bill, the idea is to have Business/Personal against each number in my address book, so that I can easily prepare an expenses claim, also handle the standard call rates, so that my free minutes don&#8217;t get given to my company ðŸ™‚ I&#8217;ve been getting very disolusioned with CDBI &#038; more interested in Java, so I might try and redo this in Trails&#8230;
