As my mother would say (sarcasticly) &#8220;sad in one so you&#8221;. I have a terrible memory, I forget things very easily (luckily my wife has the patients of a saint!), I&#8217;ve been finding a lot of interesting blogs recently & have been merrily using Blogroll It! to add them to my blog for easy reference. I&#8217;ve just discovered that I hadn&#8217;t been selecting my Blogroll as the destination, so all the links I added recently have just disappeared 🙁 I also have no idea what links I have just lost. Arse. Santa, can I have a memory upgrade?
