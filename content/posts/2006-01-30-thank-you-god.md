FOR THE WIFE
  
WHO SAYS IT&#8217;S HOT DOGS TONIGHT,
  
BECAUSE SHE IS HOME WITH ME,
  
AND NOT OUT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

FOR THE HUSBAND
  
WHO IS ON THE SOFA
  
BEING A COUCH POTATO,
  
BECAUSE HE IS HOME WITH ME
  
AND NOT OUT AT THE BARS.

FOR THE TEENAGER
  
WHO IS COMPLAINING ABOUT DOING DISHES
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS SHE IS AT HOME,
  
NOT ON THE STREETS.

FOR THE TAXES I PAY
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS
  
I AM EMPLOYED.

FOR THE MESS TO CLEAN AFTER A PARTY
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS I HAVE
  
BEEN SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS.

FOR THE CLOTHES THAT FIT A LITTLE TOO SNUG
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS
  
I HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT.

FOR MY SHADOW THAT WATCHES ME WORK
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS
  
I AM OUT IN THE SUNSHINE

FOR A LAWN THAT NEEDS MOWING,
  
WINDOWS THAT NEED CLEANING,
  
AND GUTTERS THAT NEED FIXING
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS I HAVE A HOME.

FOR ALL THE COMPLAINING
  
I HEAR ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS
  
WE HAVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH..

FOR THE PARKING SPOT
  
I FIND AT THE FAR END OF THE PARKING LOT
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS I AM CAPABLE OF WALKING
  
AND I HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH TRANSPORTATION.

FOR MY HUGE HEATING BILL
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS
  
I AM WARM.

FOR THE LADY BEHIND ME IN CHURCH
  
WHO SINGS OFF KEY BECAUSE IT MEANS
  
I CAN HEAR.

FOR THE PILE OF LAUNDRY AND IRONING
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS
  
I HAVE CLOTHES TO WEAR.

FOR WEARINESS AND ACHING MUSCLES
  
AT THE END OF THE DAY
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS I HAVE BEEN
  
CAPABLE OF WORKING HARD.

FOR THE ALARM THAT GOES OFF
  
IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS I AM ALIVE.

AND FINALLY, FOR TOO MUCH E-MAIL
  
BECAUSE IT MEANS I HAVE
  
FRIENDS WHO ARE THINKING OF ME.
