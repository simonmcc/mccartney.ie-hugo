As part of my traumatic move from a trusty Palm Treo 650 to the new Palm 500v, I&#8217;m trying to find a decent threaded SMS client that is relatively close to the PalmOS client. The pickings don&#8217;t look good, me thinks I&#8217;m just going to have to plump for a iPhone 2.0 or whatever gets announced in June.

Here&#8217;s what I have tried so far:

  * SMS [TxtMan][1]
  
    Kudos for Ben for releasing this FOC, but messages just seemed to disappear after the notification screen, I should really check the [forums][2] for more details, but I&#8217;m a man of high expectations and a short attention span.
  * Birdsoft&#8217;s [Extreme Text][3]
  
    Pro: uses the standard Outlook messaging database
  
    Con:

  * textr &#8211; no longer available?

Also, why does everything on the Palm 500v seem so slow & flaky? Lots of screen flicker.
