  * [Buttons!][1]
  
    I have some server based rules & spam training, so I need to drop any spam that hasn&#8217;t been caught in a specific folder, so that a it will get picked up by the server as spam and used to train the spam filter, the simplest way I&#8217;ve found of doing this in Thunderbird is using Buttons! to have a couple of shortcut folders on my toolbar, not quite as slick as a macro in mutt ðŸ™‚</p> 
      * [Enigmail][2]
  
        You want to sign your email? You want to encrypt it? Look no further for PKI signing & encryption</p> 
          * [Mail Redirect][3]
  
            Again, I&#8217;m trying to replace a Mutt feature I got used to, the ability to bounce mail as opposed to forward..</p> 
              * [Mnenhy][4]
  
                More Mutt, show me the headers I want to see!</p> 
                  * [Sync On Arrival][5]
  
                    Hmm, thunderbirds strong point over Mutt, built-in offline mode, although this little extension makes the offline mode a bit more useable. </ul>
