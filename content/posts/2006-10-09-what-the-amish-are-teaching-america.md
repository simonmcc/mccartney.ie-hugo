  I read this on Saturday night, it was also covered in <a href="http://www.newhopenc.org/2006/default.asp">Church</a> this morning, by <a href="http://www.newhopenc.org/2006/staff.asp">Pastor Benji</a>, here&#8217;s an excerpt:

As of that evening, three little girls were dead. Eight were hospitalized in critical condition. (One more girl has died since.) According to reports by counselors who attended the grief session, the Amish family members grappled with a number of questions: Do we send our kids to school tomorrow? What if they want to sleep in our beds tonight, is that okay? But one question they asked might surprise us outsiders. What, they wondered, can we do to help the family of the shooter? Plans were already underway for a horse-and-buggy caravan to visit Charles Carl Roberts’ family with offers of food and condolences. The Amish, it seems, don’t automatically translate their grieving into revenge. Rather, they believe in redemption.</font>
