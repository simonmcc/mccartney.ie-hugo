I&#8217;ve just moved jobs, to a predominantly Microsoft shop, so I&#8217;m getting used to using Outlook & Exchange again, after about a 5 year break. Exchange always had it&#8217;s good points, but some of those good points come with nasties, the whole calendaring & scheduling thing is great, although you have to use Outlook (or OWA) to take advantage of any of it, and there&#8217;s the rub, Outlook as an email client is woeful, top-posting is just plain wrong & stupid. 

Luckily, some lovely person has created a piece of software that fixes this terrible design decision (a design decision that would take 10min to fix if somebody in Microsoft could be bothered to accept that what they have doen is wrong!)

So, Dominik Jain, I salute you, you can find Dominik&#8217;s wonderful piece of software here: <http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/outlook-quotefix/>, It&#8217;s called Outlook-Quotefix.
