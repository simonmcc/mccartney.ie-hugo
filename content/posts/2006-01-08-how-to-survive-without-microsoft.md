I just came across a neat piece of software from [ThinkFree][1], the [ThinkFree Office Online][2]. Which is a very neat piece of software, I&#8217;ve only used it on a Debian Linux box, but it&#8217;s all Java based by the looks of it, so it should run just sweetly on Windows & OSX etc. It&#8217;s not AJAX based, the latest craze in browser based apps, but it does a hell of a lot more that your average AJAX app, and looks amazingly similar to Microsoft Office XP/2003. Which got me to thinking, what else can you get that&#8217;s browser based that makes life easy, like [Meebo][3], which is an AJAX based IM tool that supports MSN, Yahoo, GTalk etc. So never mind life with out Microsoft, the day of installing applications could be over! This is like Citrix MetaFrame for the average user!
