My last major requirement was decent hibernate & resume, the standard suspend to disk in 2.6.8/10 didn&#8217;t cut it, so I started on patching the kernel with stuff from [suspend2.net][1], but it wouldn&#8217;t patch a debian&#8217;ised kernel source, or even any kernel source I tried to pull from kernel.org, then I remembered a post on debian-laptop about a some debian&#8217;ised suspend2 patches, some hunting through my inbox and I found it:

It works a treat!
  
After you&#8217;ve built your patched kerel, grab the hibernate package from suspend2.net:

> wget http://cp.yi.org/apt/hibernate/hibernate\_1.05-1\_all.deb
> 
> dpkg -i hibernate\_1.05-1\_all.deb 

BTW, I rebuild my kernel&#8217;s slightly differently, I don&#8217;t do initrd or anything, so all I did was:

> cd /usr/src/linux
  
> make-kpkg &#8211;added-patches suspend2 &#8211;append-to-version -sm7-suspend2 kernel_image 

I do this because I sm7 indicates that this is the 7th interation of tweaking settings for this laptop, and that the suspend2 patch has been applied, it makes the kernel namesa bit long, but easier to spot what I&#8217;ve done ðŸ™‚

Reboot using your new kernel, et voila! You&#8217;re ready to hibernate, get all your usual apps up and running (Thunderbird, Firefox, Word using CrossOver), fire up a shell, su to root and type hibernate, it rocks&#8230;
