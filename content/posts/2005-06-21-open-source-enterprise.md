Yeah, I know it&#8217;s everybodies favorite buzz word, but here&#8217;s some software that will try and free you from buying Windows Servers, Group Policies are **good**

To me, the idea behind the Open Source Enterprise is to reduce cost, improve flexibility & maintainability. It&#8217;s likely that there will always be a need for Windows desktops in most SMEs, unless it&#8217;s a clean sheet site & you can avoid getting locked in at the start. With tools like these, you should still be able to carry on reduing your Windows count.
