Even though been having some [issues][1] with OpenNMS, I was very glad to see this:

Subject: [opennms-announce] OpenNMS Named Winner of the Best Systems Management Tools Category at LinuxWorld

Gang:

I thought you might enjoy one the following press releases. Thanks
  
for helping to create the community that makes OpenNMS possible. Give
  
yourself a round of applause.

PITTSBORO, NC &#8211; 9 August 2005 &#8211; OpenNMS has won a Product Excellence
  
Award at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo being held in San
  
Francisco. The open-source network management application was chosen
  
as the winning solution in the &#8220;Best Systems Management Tools&#8221; Category.

OpenNMS was chosen out of a field that included IBM&#8217;s Tivoli
  
Intelligent Orchestrator, Novell&#8217;s ZENWorks 7 Linux Management
  
product and Userful&#8217;s DiscoverStation.

OpenNMS is the first enterprise-grade network management product to
  
be developed using the open-source model. It was designed from day
  
one to be able to monitor tens of thousands of devices from a single
  
instance of the application, and it aims to offer a better
  
alternative to expensive commercial products such as Hewlett-
  
Packard&#8217;s OpenView, Micromuse Netcool, and IBM&#8217;s Tivoli. The software
  
is freely available and is supported by an international community of
  
users and developers.

The current development release, known as version 1.3.0, includes
  
enhancements such as support for SNMP version 3, the ability to
  
monitor JMX-based application servers such as JBoss, and improved
  
event management through the use of alarm reduction.
