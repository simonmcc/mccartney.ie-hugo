I changed jobs back in October 2005, and became a Microsofty again (well, only on my work laptop), at the weekend I lost it again and ditched XP in favour of Ubuntu Edgy Eft, &#8216;cos getting Debian on a laptop and getting all the funky bits working is just too much like hardwork.

One of the companies I work for uses OWA for all non-corporate laptop email access.

OWA for Ex2k3 sucks on anything but IE. Some kind soul has scripted up an IE6 installation using Wine. Love it.
