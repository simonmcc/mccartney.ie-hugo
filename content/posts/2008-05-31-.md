I&#8217;ve been dipping my toe in the jBPM world recently, and where as the technology is impressive, there&#8217;s a huge hurdle just trying to understand what you need to get started! Consider the following

http://www.jboss.org/jbossjbpm/jbpm_downloads/

  * jPDL Suite 3.2.2
  * jPDL Runtime 3.2.2
  * jBPM BPEL 1.1
  * jBPM GPD 3.1.3
  * PVM 1.0.alpha2

From the jPDL sub-project

  * jbpm-jpdl-3.2.2 runtime
  * jbpm-3.1.4 runtime
  * jbpm-3.0.4 runtime
  * jbpm-jpdl-suite-3.2.2
  * jbpm-starters-kit-3.1.4
  * jbpm-starters-kit-3.0.4

Also available

  * jbpm-bpel-1.1.GA
  * jbpm-jpdl-designer-3.1.3
  * jbpm-jpdl-designer-3.0.13
  * pvm-1.0alpha2

Where the hell do you start!
