    Just incase I ever get famous enough for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs" target="_blank">Desert Island Discs</a>, here&#8217;s my 8 tracks.

  <ol>
    <li>
      REM &#8211; Nightswimming<br /> This is probably as close as Emma & I get to &#8220;our song&#8221;, it reminds me of all sorts of things from when we started going out, listening to it in Ritchies bar in Hillsborough, going to see REM in Slane 1995 (Slane is a seminal moment is most peoples music lives where we grew up, REM were supported by a small band called Oasis)
    </li>
    <li>
      The 4 of Us &#8211; Mary<br /> School. A mix tape.  Given to me by Julie Smith, I sat behind her and in Physics, I may not have survived GCSE physics without that view.  I have a real soft spot for song that tell stories without being overly complex & obtuse, I still get shivers down my spine when I sing along.  I went to see The 4 Of Us in Edinburgh & Lisburn, probably 15 years apart, thrilling & exciting experiences both times.
