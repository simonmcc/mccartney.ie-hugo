I just spotted a new way of displaying your website hit stats on [Corante&#8217;s Get Real][1] blog. I soo want one ðŸ™‚ I&#8217;ve mailed [ClustrMaps][2] asking to be added to the beta..here&#8217;s hoping they succumb!

**UPDATE:**
  
They succumbed! I&#8217;ve just got this great email from Marc @ ClustrMap:

> Hi, Simon &#8212; 
> 
> First of all please let me apologize for the delay in replying to you&#8230;
  
> we are just catching up on a huge email backlog and I can assure you that our
  
> intention is to respond in the future to any emails within 24 hours at the
  
> most, and more typically within 4.
> 
> Secondly, this is to let you know that we&#8217;re delighted to invite you onto our
  
> beta test (in case you have not already obtained in invitation from
  
> elsewhere). &#8230;
