I&#8217;m building an offsite digital vault, so that my current employers can stream all our backups to this box which will be based about 100 miles from our current office. Here&#8217;s some notes on what will be required to get Debian Sarge up and running on Supermicro H8DAR Opteron mobo with a pair of 3Ware 9000 SATA cards. (we&#8217;re using a 16 disk, 3u box from [PCI Case][1], which is a great box, but with hind sight, our mobo suppliers, [Boston][2], do a rather nice 3u 16 disk dual opteron box with 3Ware cards, all for abou 300ukp more that we bought the parts, a much better solution..)

Anyways, getting Debian Sarge on this box might be tricky, so I&#8217;ve been doing some reading &#038; prep work:
