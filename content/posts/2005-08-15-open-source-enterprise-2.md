I&#8217;ve muttered before on the Open Source Enterprise, (you know, the one where we pay for somebodies skills in installing & maintaining the software, not for somebody to develop it, and then pay through the nose depending on how much we want to use the software, as well as paying for somebody to install & maintain it)

Anyways, InfoWorld has loose collection of articles on Open Source in the enterprise, you see it [here][1]
