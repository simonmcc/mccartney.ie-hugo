Is it right that you should live in dread of the phone ringing? Or opening your email?

I&#8217;m not talking about being stalked, or chased by creditors. I&#8217;m talking about the latest communication from the office. It&#8217;s not right that your heart drops when you have a missed call from somebody, or email from somebody.
