This morning I was supposed to nip over to London to meet & greet a new member of the team in one of our London based clients. I booked myself on FlyBE&#8217;s 0650 from Belfast City. When I got up this morning I could hear the wind rattle the window frames in our house, I thought to myself &#8220;Hmmm, taking off is going to be fun&#8221;.

When I got in the car, BBC Radio 4 was still on the World Service & doing the shipping forecast, then came the weather for us non-fishermen-types. London is fog bound, expect delays on any high speed transport (i.e. Road & Plane). Great.

I got to the airport in plenty of time (home to BHD is about 30min at that time of day), got through the horrendous queues at security, had a cup of coffee and some toast, all very civilised. We even boarded the plane on time & took off.

About halfway through the 105min flight, the pilot announced over the tannoy that we had a problem with one of the generators, and that in light of this and the bad weather in London Gatwick, we would divert to Manchester. The descent was a bit bumpy, but the landing was really smooth, just for full dramatic effect we had the fire brigade on standby at the side of the runway, blue lights flashing away.
