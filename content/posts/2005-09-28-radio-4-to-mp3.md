My wife asked me to see if I could get a copy of a BBC Radio 4 program into MP3 for her boss, the program was on the freedom of information act, called [A Right to Know][1], you can listen to it [here][2]. The BBC make most of there radio content available under &#8220;Listen Again&#8221;, where you can stream it using Real Player, so I don&#8217;t feel too bad about ripping it.

There are plenty of Windows &#038; MacOS apps to do this kind of thing, but I run Debian Linux, so here&#8217;s what I did:

  1. Get the contents of the RAM file, this is usually just a RTSP URL, do a wget or something similar, then pass the rtsp url to mplayer:
  2. mplayer rtsp://rmv8.bbc.net.uk/radio4/tue2002.ra -ao pcm:file=right\_to\_know.wav -vc dummy -vo null
  3. Now that you have a wav of the show, you really want to convert to something a bit more compact, like mp3: 
    lame -m m right\_to\_know.wav right\_to\_know.mp3 &#8211;tt &#8220;Right to Know&#8221; &#8211;ta &#8220;Michael Crick, BBC Radio 4&#8221;
    
    the &#8220;-m m&#8221; says create a mono MP3, which should be more compact &#038; perfectly adequate for spoken word.</li> </ol>
