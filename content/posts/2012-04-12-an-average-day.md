There is no such thing as an average or normal day, but here&#8217;s what <del>today</del>Â yesterday looked like (the first day back after a 6 day break):

  * 1000-1200 Wiki Gardening &#8211; moving some WIP from my head/evernote to team wiki pages
  * 1200-1230 Monitoring & Measuring Catchup &#8211; a quick check around on the stuff we don&#8217;t get alerted about, checkup on some new nodes I added to cacti before I finished up last week.
  * 1230-1330 Reading &#8211; closing out a bunch of open tabs etc
  * 1330-1430 Lunch (the joy of working from home, soup & sandwiches with family:-))
  * 1430-1600 Open CM tickets for up coming changes, upgrade Puppet Dashboard, publish some more strategy information on our internal wiki. Â Work through the dreaded email back log.

  * 1800-2100 Family Time &#8211; help the kids tidy up & get them to bed, get something to eat
