Kudos to Tom Rossi over at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.themolehill.com">www.themolehill.com</a>, where I have just read one of the best intro&#8217;s to RoR yet, simple, clean &#038; informative.

Many of the articles I have read over recent months either work too hard at showing how quickly you can do stuff, or how brief Ruby is, without giving the detail to help put the pieces of the puzzle together. (i.e. I&#8217;m a system admin coder/hacker, I know what MVC is, but I&#8217;ve never used it in anger, I&#8217;m used to scripting out problems &#038; fiddling with databases)
