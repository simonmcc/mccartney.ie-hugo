If you use firefox, you need [Tab Mix Plus][1]. The site is here, and you can install it from [here][2]. I used to use Session Saver .2 & some japanese fellow&#8217;s Tabbed Browsing Extensions, but this does it all, it&#8217;s much slicker & I&#8217;m very happy ðŸ™‚

Update: 14th July 2006
  
I&#8217;m considering adding [Bookmarks Synchronizer 3][3] to this list..
