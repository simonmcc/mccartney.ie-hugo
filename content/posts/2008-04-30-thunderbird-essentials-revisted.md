I wrote this some [time][1] ago, [Thunderbird][2] has moved on quite a bit since then (I&#8217;m now running 2.0.0.12 on my XP laptop), so here&#8217;s a quick roundup on the Add-ons/Extensions installed:

  * [British English Dictionary][3]
  
    Hey, colour has a u in it.
  * [GMailUI][4]
  
    mostly just so that I can use j/k to navigate around
  * [Lightening][5]
  
    Quickly check my published calendars (also see this: [exchange to ics][6]).
  * [Mnenhy][7]
  
    Mostly so that I can see what SpamAssassin (personal) or PureMessage (work) has thought of the email.
  * [Nostalgy][8]
  
    The major time saver for me these days, rapid filing of email, works well across IMAP accounts.

I was having various problems with GMailUI & Keyconfig not playing together properly, but Nostalgy has largely removed my need for keyconfig, as the rapid filing using Nostalgy&#8217;s Save function is great.
