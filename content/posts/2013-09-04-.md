I often think about blogging (or just documenting stuff in my life for my own benefit) things long after they&#8217;ve happened, one of the reasons this place is a bit spartan at time, anyway, a post by <a target="_blank" href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Robert Scoble</a> <a rel="bookmark" href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/03/dont-break-the-web-im-off-the-grid/">Don’t break the Web — I’m off the grid</a>, made me think about some of the products and people I&#8217;ve worked with in the past, so I&#8217;m going to try pull some of them together here:

  1. First real IT job &#8211; I did my placement year from QUB in [Unibol][1], at the time one of Northern Ireland&#8217;s leading software companies, I worked with some great people there &#8211; I worked in the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980126145520/http://www.unibol.com/products/desktop/Mainud.htm">UNIBOL/Desktop</a> team, with Ian, Ian, Ian &#038; Hugh.  I never really left after my placement year, I continued to work there during final year and for several years afterwards.
  2. FTEL/FTSI/FNC/FTEL-NAPG &#8211; After Unibol I went to work for Fujitsu Telecommunications, hired as a software developer, something I never really got to do there, looked after all the network in Belfast instead.  Met some great people, worked with some really bright &#038; influential infrastructure people in the Birmingham team
