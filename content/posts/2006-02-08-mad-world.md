I was watching CSI last night, the song they opened & closed the show was quite cool and hit my current mood spot on (sound wise, not quite lyric wise..), so I did some googling & discovered that it was a cover of a Tears for Fears song, Mad World, the cover was by Gary Jules, you can hear & see it [here][1].
