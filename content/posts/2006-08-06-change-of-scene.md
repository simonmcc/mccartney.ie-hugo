On the 15th July I jumped on a place (well, two planes, and jumped is hardly right, as easyJet stung me an extra Â£40 for being over weight[1]) and headed to Durham, North Carolina, for a couple of months, work offered me an exciting opertunity, and after some discussions with my wife, we took it, she joined me here a week later. Her work has been good enough to let her take some extended leave so she can spend the time with me out here, she joind me out here a week later.
  
We&#8217;ve been living in a hotel since we got here, but on Wednesday we move into an apartment in Chapel Hill, NC, about 15 minutes from the office &#038; the hotel we are in now.

So far everything has gone very smoothly, no major hassles or problems.

Before I left, we had a big family &#038; friends BBQ at our house, and although the weather did it&#8217;s best to put a dampner on the whole thing (I ended up BBQing in the garage door, helped by my Dad and my brother in-law, the garage now stinks of food..) it was great to see everybody and I was touched to hear everybodies good wishes. Thank you to everybody who turned up and even to those who couldn&#8217;t ðŸ™‚

We&#8217;ve been out and about trying to explore our new surroundings, doing our best not to die in the <a title="heat" target="_blank" href="http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld/myrtlebeachonline/news/local/15204979.htm">heat.</a>

So far we&#8217;ve eaten are way round most of the local places (living in a hotel does have draw back, constantly eating out becomes a chore and is doing my waistline no favours at all), shopped at the local [mega mall][1] and smaller strip malls, been to [Jordan Lake][2], the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncmls.org/">Museum of Life &#038; Sciences</a>.
