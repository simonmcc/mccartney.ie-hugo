A friend of mine, Robert, is on the committee for the Northern Ireland Charolais Club, the club usually runs a BBQ during the summer (with some fine charolais steaks!) as a fund raiser, this year was the biggest that I&#8217;ve been to so far, apparently over 800 people turned up! Friends of ours, Chris & Cheryl flew back for the special event. Now, Chris is notoriously conservative when it comes to spending money, which is why it came as a huge shock to us (and his fiance!) that he was the winning bidder on a _life size, anatomically correct, plastic cutout of a Charolais Bull_. Wonders will never cease.
