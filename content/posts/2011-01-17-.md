The ever impressive [Andy McMillan][1] was let down by the local telco in providing wireless internet access for his [Build][2] conference.&#160; At short notice (about 9 days before the event) I was asked if I could help at all.&#160; I’ve installed some low volume Pay For Access Hotspot systems before, but conference wifi, particularly a tech/web conference, where its more than possible that every attendee has at least 2 wifi devices on them (iPhone, Laptop etc), is a very different problem. A quick chat with Andy revealed the following:

  * 300 attendees 
  * separate VIP/Stage Internet Access required 
  * The [Waterfront Studio][3] is 500m<sup>2</sup>, but we really want to to cover an [18m x 18m][4] area where 90% of the audience will be 
  * There are up to 3 BT Business DSL lines we can use, attached to standard 2wire Business Hubs (these are what failed miserable the previous year) 

Two wifi hardware vendors stood out as producers equipment designed to handle hight numbers of clients in a dense area, [Aruba Networks][5] & [Xirrus][6].

I contacted both vendors, Xirrus’s demo/loan unit was already out on loan & put me in touch with a client that runs Event Wifi as part of their service offering, we ran through the requirements and they came back with a price of £3.5k.&#160; Aruba quickly put me in touch with a Dublin based supplier, who offered a man, a van & the suitable Aruba kit for the day, again at pretty close to the £3.5k mark.

I started sniffing around eBay for suitable equipment, I found some nice Aruba kit that would have come close to providing the bulk of the requirements ([Aruba 200 Mobility Controller + 2 x AP65 Access Points][7]), but I got sniped at the last minute, besides, what I built in the end had a slightly higher capacity, if a little less easy to manage.

I started researching the capacity of various access points, one thing stuck out, vendors are extremely vague about the number of clients there APs can support. However, Netgear go on the record on stating that their <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk/wireless_accesspoint_wg102.php" target="_blank">WG102</a> & <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk/wireless_accesspoint_wag102.php" target="_blank">WAG102</a> units support 64 & 128 users (I’ve since discovered that that’s per radio, so the WAG-102 supports 64 users on the 2.4Ghz radio & another 64 users on the 5Ghz radio, which makes sense, but isn’t particularly clear from the marketing blurb)

My rough calculations told me that 3&#215;128=384 slots for the public network & 1&#215;64 slots for the VIP network would cover the venue fine, I found a WG102 in the local PC World, bought it & did some testing (mostly pointing <a href="http://www.cacti.net/" target="_blank">Cacti</a> at it and trying to get every wifi device in the house to connect to it, that’s 3x iPhones, 7x laptops, an iPad, a Wii, a MacMini & a Blackberry, there’s only 2 adults in this house…), the WG102 didn’t even blink, so I ordered up another 3 WAG102s and <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk/business_unmanaged_desktop_fast_ethernet.php" target="_blank">Netgear FS108P</a> to help keep the cabling tidy, along with a load of long premade CAT5e cable, all from Amazon, I then started praying that the next day delivery wouldn’t let me down (I ordered on the Sunday night, they shipped on Monday, I got them on Tuesday, spent Tuesday night checking the kit, putting the latest firmware on, setting the SSID, recording MAC addresses etc, all ready for heading to the venue at 6am on the Wednesday, this is Just In Time procurement <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.mccartney.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wlEmoticon-smile.png" />)

I was concerned about 300 users maxing out the bandwidth of a single DSL line, so I wanted to be able to load balance across the available DSL lines, if I had time I probably would have built a linux based router to do this, but as I wanted something working as quickly as possible with minimal fuss, I ordered a <a href="http://www.draytek.co.uk/products/vigor2930.html" target="_blank">Draytek 2930</a> with dual WAN ethernet ports, so that I could load balance over at least 2 of the DSL lines (through the BT BusinessHubs, we only had ethernet presentation on site).

&#160;

## The Night before

As I mentioned, I spent the night before the event bring the netgear APs up to the same firmware version, recording MAC addresses, setting SSIDs, checking that the POE switch could power 4 APs etc, I also started to setup the Drayek router, which is when I discovered the first flaw in this device, attempting to get the built-in DHCP server to serve more than 256 addresses is impossible, as I was expecting 300+ devices, this was a bit of a stumbler.&#160; 

I’d already built an Ubuntu laptop to run cacti, so getting ISC DHCPD running on it wasn’t a big issue, just a pain.&#160; While I was at it I put dnsmasq on and proxied the DNS requests through the laptop, for logging purposes. (Yes, I know I could have used the dhcp server in dnsmasq, but I just prefer the ISC DHCP server as it’s what I use everywhere else..)

FWIW, I set the APs to get there IP address & other setting from the DHCP server, which I then had static IP assigned to them in the DHCP server, this allows me to quickly change network settings in once place & power cycle the APs to collect new settings, instead of having to manually configure them all again.

&#160;

## the big day

I arrived early, before 7am I think, to start getting setup, hit the first problem, the stage crew could only get me 2 ethernet connections to my temporary NOC above the stage (I planned to have 2 for the dual WAN router for public access, reserving a DSL line for the VIP access around the stage).
