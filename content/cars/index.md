  1. Fiat Uno &#8211; died in an accident at the junction of Lambeg Road & River Road in Lisburn
  2. Peugeot 309 3dr
  3. Peugeot 306 XT &#8211; stolen from the Corporation Street car park by some scum bag, with a load of engagement gifts in it üôÅ
  4. VW Golf MKII &#8211; in gold, with lots of rust & horse hair seats _given to the local scrap yard!_
  5. <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHskgcsDc6" target="_blank">1995 Audi A4 Saloon 1.8 20v</a>
  6. 2002 Audi A6 Avant 1.9TDI SE (Awesome car. ¬†Chipped to 170bhp, still got 40mpg, set of nice [18&#8243; 9-spoke Audi wheels][1] towards the end)
  7. [Peugeot 308 SW 1.6 HDI][2], 6 speed, panoramic sun roof. ¬†(The A6 had to go, needed something with room for 3 ISOFIX car seats in the back, baby 3.0 due mid-May 2012, PX the A6 in Jan 2012 as it had some big bills looming)

From July-November 2006 we lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where we got to hire some interesting rides:

  1. Chrysler 300C
  2. Ford Taurus &#8211; urgh.
  3. Jeep Liberty
  4. [Dodge Charger][3] &#8211; loved it! So tempted to get a Chrysler 300T over here and order in a new Chrager/Magnum frontend
  5. Jeep Commander &#8211; <a title="Jeep Pics" href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/simon.mccartney/Jeep" target="_blank">HUGE</a>!
