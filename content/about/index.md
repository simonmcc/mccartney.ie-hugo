This is me.

I&#8217;m a husband, father, technology fan, car enthusiast, eclectic music collector, Manx man and beer fan.

I was born on the Isle of Man, but grew up in Northern Ireland, where I still live with my wife.  I&#8217;ve travelled the world for work and pleasure, but mostly work.  I work for a Nothern Ireland-based technology company specialising in mobile content delivery platforms.
